# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-US-Accidents
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of US accidents using Jupyter Notebook. The analysis uses various Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and mapping libraries to clean and visualize the data.

--Data
The data used in this analysis is the US Accidents (3.5 million records) dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about traffic accidents in the US from February 2016 to December 2020.

--Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA covers various aspects of the US accidents data, such as:

1.Data cleaning: handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and correcting data types.
2.Data visualization: using Seaborn and other visualization libraries to explore the distribution of accidents by state, time of day, weather condition, and other factors.
3.Mapping: using mapping libraries to visualize the geographical distribution of accidents.
4.The analysis aims to provide insights into the US accidents data and identify patterns and trends that can inform policy and decision-making.

--Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook and replicate the analysis, you will need the following libraries:
  NumPy
  Pandas
  Seaborn
  Matplotlib
  Plotly
  Folium
You can install these libraries using pip or Anaconda.
